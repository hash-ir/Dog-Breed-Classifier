# Dog Breed Classifier
This repository is my solution to `Project 2` of Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). In this project, I built two CNN models which&mdash;given an image of a dog&mdash;identify an estimate of the canine's breed (e.g Labrador Retriever, Chihuahua,...). Otherwise &mdash;when given an image of a human&mdash;identify the resembling dog breed.

## Models
* A CNN model made from scratch
* A pretrained model (VGG16) modified for the given problem
